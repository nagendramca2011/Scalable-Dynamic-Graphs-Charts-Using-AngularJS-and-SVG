 SVG is entirely new technology but i think its under publicised and utilized. When come to graphics for the web is an excellent choice. Your browser is capable of producing svg graphics. No need for third party plugins, and no need to learn new syntax.
 
SVG is looks like a HTML and XML. To make this graph make adaptable and dynamic we need the support of AngularJS in this course. The powerful and popular scripting library. With AngularJS we are able to add Animation to our SVG graphics. And we have ability to change the graphics in real-time as day to day changes.Most importantly angularjs give us the ability to organize our code.
